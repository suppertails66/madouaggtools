  C000 = array of object??? slots
         0x20 bytes each
  C4C0 = queue of pending vdp transfers?
         8 6-byte structs?
  C4F0 = vdp transfer queue end index
  C4F1 = vdp transfer queue start index
  C580+ = vdp regs?
          but not all?
  C581 = vdp reg 1?
  C588 = ? NOT vdp reg 8
  C589 = ?
  C58A = ? flags?
         see CDD, CBB...
  C5C4 = ?
  C700 = temporary buffer for composing stuff
         this gets copied to and (partially?) read from vram 3d40,
         the tilemap for the cropped-out bottom area of the screen.
         used at least for writing new text to screen...? (via ~DCF)
  C880 = ? scripts?
  C881 = ? flags?
         bit 5 = ?
         bit 6 = ?

  CA81 = arle level?
  CB2E = arle current hp

routines:
  11F8 = decmpTilemap
  1774 = decmpGrp
         (same compressed format as madou3)

         de = vdp dstaddr
         hl = src
  1D98 = bankTableItemLookup
  1DE3 = getPointerFromMultiTable
         looks up 16-bit data from what may be either a pointer or offset table
  1DF7 = loadEncodedPage
         loads (A & 0x7F) to slot 1 if top bit is unset,
         and to slot 2 otherwise
  1E32 = savePageRegs
  1E3E = restorePageRegs

          A = index
          C = flags

          A = clear value
          B = height
          C = width
  3BE81 = send tilemap (for e.g. title screen)
          half-width format

data:
  1A069 = locations of script tables by region (0xB 2-byte entries total)
          - byte0 = target table index num in bank table
          - byte1 = source page ID (bank num)

some text not assigned to a region (intro? ending?) seems to be at 1A8FC
(cutscenes)

frog pond requires you to be level 12 to freeze (see 14209).
gameplay!!
and must be level 15 to clear fog fountain

TODO
  - graphics
  - top 3 rows of tilemap are probably not free.
    - also, game shakes screen without clearing whatever it's shoved there...
    - 3E60+ are probably available though, and last 4-5 tiles of bg patterns?
  - "sorcery ribbon"
  - "you mastered"
  - remove redundant vdp sends in printVwfChar -- no cbc printing

DONE
  - cutscene text
  - money printing
  - properly clear cropped area when title screen starts (vertical scrolling
    reveals top area)
